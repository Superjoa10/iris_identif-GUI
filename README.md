# Iris Flower Identification
  This project is a demonstration of the skills I acquired in the CS50AI course offered by HarvardX,  with a focus on TensorFlow technology. It uses a database to describe the length and         width of three species of iris (Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor)  which are found mainly in the United States.

# Tutorial 
The App is a user interface, that gives 2 options on how to predict the instances of the flower given the width and length of the petal and sepal,

# Model information (TensorFlow)


* This project is not ment for professional use, it serves as a demonstration of the capabilities of my abilities in tensorflow, model definition for predictions, as well as a visualization of the idea, creation of the user interface in a way a non programer could easely visualize and use.
