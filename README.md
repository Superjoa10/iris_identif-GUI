# iris_identif
  This project is a demonstration of the skills I acquired in the CS50AI course offered by HarvardX,  with a focus on TensorFlow technology. It uses a database to describe the length and  width of three species of iris (Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor)  which are found mainly in the United States.
